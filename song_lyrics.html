        <h4>Lyrics</h4>
        <pre>
        They tell me keep it simple, I tell them take it slow
        I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
        I tell them take it easy, they laugh and tell me no
        It's cool but I don't see them laughing at my money though
        They spittin' facts at me, I'm spittin' tracks, catch me?
        I'm spinning gold out my records know you can't combat me
        They tell me Jesus walks, I tell them money talks
        Bling got me chill, cause I'm living in an icebox
        They tell me I've been sleepin', I say I'm wide awake
        Tracks hot and ready so they call me mister e-z bake
        They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank
        Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank
        Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
        The people always different but it always feels the same
        That's the real me. Pop the champagne.
        The haters wanna hurt me and I'm laughin' at the pain
        Stayin' still, eyes closed
        Let the world just pass me by
        Pain pills, nice clothes
        If I fall I think I'll fly
        Touch me, Midas
        Make me part of your design
        None to guide us
        I feel fear for the very last time
        They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head
        I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
        They tell me I'm so humble, I say I'm turning red
        They let me lie to them and don't feel like they've been misled
        They give so much to me, I'm losing touch get me?
        Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds they just let me
        They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the fa√ßade
        Six feet off the ground at all times I think I'm feelin' odd
        No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
        Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
        They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
        The people blend together but I would be lost without their love
        Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?
        When you become untouchable you're unable to touch
        Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
        It hurts me just to think and I don't do pain
        Stayin' still, eyes closed
        Let the world just pass me by
        Pain pills, nice clothes
        If I fall I think I'll fly
        Touch me, Midas
        Make me part of your design
        None to guide us
        I feel fear for the very last time
        Lay still, restless
        Losing sleep while I lose my mind
        All thrill, no stress
        All my muses left behind
        World is below
        So high up, I'm near divine
        Lean in, let go
        I feel fear for the very last time
        </pre>
